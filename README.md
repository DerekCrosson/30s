# 30s

Thirty Seconds is a game in which you play to gain both knowledge and fun.
> It's a very nice game to play with your friends, but also with your family.

## Instllation
- Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
- If you have your device plugged in or an emulator set up, you can simply run `yarn start` to start the game.
- Create a team and start playing :)
> I built this game targetting Arabic speakers(because didn't find a 30s game in Arabic). So everything is in Arabic! If you think it should be available in other languages, please make a pull request! 

## How to play ✌?
First of all you'll have to have an opponent. There can be 2 or more teams in the game.
After you've chosen the teams, you're basically ready to go.

The time will start once you click on 'ready' and then you'll see the questions(choices).
> By default the timer is set to 30s, but it's adjustable.

There will be several questions(choices) from which you'll have to explain to your teammates what each of these means and if correct click on it to select as guessed. Once the time is done you'll see the result screen and who is next.

### The winner?
Once a team reaches 30 points, they win.
> By default a team must reach 30 points to win, but it's adjustable.

## Rules ◕‿↼
Players are called describers and identifiers. All players must take their turn at being both describers and identifiers. The describer within a team must rotate with each turn.

1. The description of any term CAN be through:
    - describing the names in any way they wish, including singing, humming and gesticulating;
    - describing the names in any order;
    - using the words ‘and’ and ‘the’ that appear in some of the names.

2. The description of any term CANNOT be through:
    - saying the actual names of the terms displayed.
    - saying any names or words derived from or related to the names they are describing.
    - using any ‘sounds-like’ or ‘rhymes-with’ tactics.
    - saying or referring to the letters of the alphabet.
    - using translations.
    - pointing to objects
